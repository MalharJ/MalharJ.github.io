        <br> The premise </br>
        <p align="justify">Evidence shows that outlier success in scientific careers, such as Physics, Engineering, Biology, Mathematics or Chemistry, is more a war of attrition
        then a war of intelligence. Geoff Hinton, the recent Turing award winner who pioneered neural networks, lived through
        2 AI winters where funding for AI research dried up for decades and he had to change countries to continue his research. He worked on neural nets for over
        40 years without ever giving up or wavering his attention, and it ended up in him becoming one of the most decorated researchers we have today.
        Einstein was famously known to be unbelievably stubborn as a physicist; he diligently worked
        on the problem of Special Relativity in complete isolation for well over 10 years for at least 4 hours a day. In 
        Einstein's biography it was mentioned that he would return from his teaching position as a professor, eat dinner, go for a walk,
        and resume his research work well into the night, and would repeat this for decades at a time. Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat's Last Theorem, worked in complete isolation for 7 years on his proof, which culminated in a 100
        page long document. Richard Feynman's first wife divorced him, and in the divorce proceedings his wife quoted 
        "He did math as soon as he arose, while he drove his car, even while lying in bed at night‚Äù. It's almost as if these individuals
        had some sort of ability (or condition, I might add) whereby they could focus abstractly on a problem for extended periods of time, up to years at a time, ignoring everything
        and everyone around them, and not lose any sense of hope or gain any sense of despair or anxiety that their work might not lead anywhere or that their life's work might be wrong. 
        Their ability to obsess about a particular problem and keep attacking it relentlessly, almost like a machine that doesn't know
        when to give up, made them stand out among others like Mt. Kilimanjaro in the savannah. </p>
        
        <p align="justify"> While these traits extremely helpful to their careers, it often caused chaos to those who loved them and those 
        who were around them. From a mammalian point of view, social bonds that and loving relationships are essential to most
        humans to function normally, but if your life's work and passion is solving an insurmountable problem, then it
        becomes more likely that famous scientists give less value to relationships, emotions and feelings, which is of course
        perfectly normal for them, but might seem abhorrent to the vast majority of humans. </p>
        
        <br> Insecurities of a PhD student </br>
        <p align="justify"> As a budding researcher who loves working science and advancing human knowledge, I will personally admit that I have been using their stories of persistence and hard work and diligence as a 
        form of motivation for myself, to make myself a successful researcher that is capable of producing deep, original and creative work. Like the vast majority of humans, I too suffer
        constantly from self-doubt, anxiety about my work, imposter syndrome, and the fear of missing out on working on exciting industries, traveling the world, or making oodles of money
        working at a big tech company. I try to stem these feelings through exercise or meditation or reading books or music or reminding myself of the struggles of the scientists before me,
        but I'm starting to realize that what I perceive as struggles are not necessary what my idols might perceive as struggles. </p>
        
        <p align="justify"> I'm starting to believe more and more that the personality traits required to become a successful scientist are no different than those required to become a successful 
        musician or artist or entrepreneur; one must be either hard-wired to be resistant to embrace rejection, failure and disappointment
        as a constant daily occurrence that is completely unavoidable much like facing daily traffic or unlocking your car, or have gone through
        significantly traumatic experiences to the point where one is immune to these feelings. In the words of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the key to constant improvement in life
        is antifragility, where you become stronger and stronger the more you get beaten down or defeated. Antifragility is a powerful idea, and is quite hard to achieve. </p>
        
        <p align="justify"> On the big-5 scale, such individuals would score quite low on the agreeableness, low on the neuroticism scale, and high on conscientiousness scale. One must be so self-motivated to work
        through constant strife and disparagement that it must merely bounce off of them. Inspired by the words of Socrates, namely 'Know Thyself', 
        I decidedly took the DSM-5 test myself, and I scored quite differently to those expected of scientists. I'm very agreeable, moderately neurotic, and decently conscientiousness.  </p>
        
        <p align="justify"> When I take a look at these facts, I realize that there are two paths I can take.  </p>
        
        <p align="justify"> I can either try and change my personality to make myself like the people above, or I can simply quit.  </p>
        
        <p align="justify"> The question that arises is, is it worth the literal <br> herculean </br> mental, physical and emotional effort to make fundamental changes to
        my personality over the next 3-5 years to make myself more resilient, or should I take the easier route and find a life more suited to my 
        current personality and strengths? This is a dilemma I constantly face myself confronting, and I honestly don't know how to deal with it. </p>
        
        <br> Generalizing </br>
        <p align="justify"> The sheer lack of social isolation, the ridiculous amount of dry and painstaking work and experiments that have to be set up, the extremely slow feedback and iteration cycles of academia, and lack of support
        from other students going through the same might lead to academia turning into a breeding ground for depression, which is in fact
        absolutely the case. In a paper published by Nature Biotechnology [1], there is a mental health <br> crisis </br> among graduate students. 39% of
        graduate students face moderate to severe depression, as compared to 6 percent of the general population. Breaking it down by gender, 55% of transgender,
        57% of gender-nonconforming, 41% of women, and 35% of men had depression. </p>
        
        <p align="justify"> These are serious numbers, and are not talked about as often. Last year someone in my graduate dorm committed suicide, and the official reaction
        among my peers was to not talk about it and sweep it under the rug. Although my evidence is anecdotal, it might point to a dangerous and 
        insidious situation happening at prominent research universities around the world, namely this mental health crisis among budding acaedemics
        that only seems to be getting worse. </p>
        
        <p align="justify"> Most people I know who are working towards advanced degrees were inspired by science and mathematics at some point in their life and found
        true joy and meaning in it, but I believe that many have been misinformed about the perils and dangers that come with attempting
        to become a researcher. I try to find joy in the work that I do, and occasionally I do indeed, but its quite hard to not distract
        myself with all the endless opportunities available to me outside of academia. </p>
        
        <br> Final thoughts </br>
        <p align="justify"> Normally at the end of such a tirade you, the reader, would expect me to say that I have a grand solution to tackle this internal conflict that goes on in my head, but I don't. I have tried
        everything, from calculating opportunity costs of getting a PhD to speaking to family and friends who've been through the gladiator arena of a
        PhD, to reading biographies of those who inspired me such as Einstein, Feynman, Ramanajuna and Marie Curie, but its hard.  </p>
