        Lately I've begun pondering a great deal about life and intelligence. Life on Earth as we know it is the only 
        form of life that we know exists for sure in the universe, and of those billions of species that we know currently 
        exist only a miniscule fraction actually possess any sort of crude or rudimentary intelligence. Life can exist 
        without intelligence, as is evident all across the world. 
        
        But can intelligence exist without life? If so, what does it mean for something to be intelligent?
        
        On a related side note, Artificial Intelligence has had somewhat of a renaissance lately. In particular, Deep Learning,
        a form of Machine Learning, has demonstrated incredible successes at a variety of different tasks, ranging from
        image recognition, object detection, audio recognition, speech-to-text translation, language translation to general
        game playing, and has been the driving force between all the hype we see in A.I today.
        
        I like to point out the example of Chess and Go, and AlphaGo and AlphaZero in particular. Researchers at DeepMind 
        were able to train AI that could beat the world champions of Chess and Go (albeit with metric tons of data and compute),
        and the method that demonstrated that success is slowly taking over other games as well, from Poker to Starcraft to Dota.
        
        If we peek under the hood, all we find are convolutional neural nets. That's it! ConvNets are responsible for a 
        ridiculous number of innovations in Deep Learning, and they're responsible for beating the world champions! These benign,
        10 MB networks can beat thousands of years of training and expertise of humans, and not only do they beat humans, they 
        wipe the floor with them!
        
        <br></br>
        
        Is human intelligence then limited? Are human brains limited by their physical size and structure, by our skulls and by our rate of growth of new neurons?

        But even then what is intelligence (coming back to our original question)? In my limited opinion, our universe consists of a massive physical system with subsystems, 
        each subsystem consisting of a set of its own rules governing its behavior. Subsystems may or may not be connected. Our atmosphere is a subsystem governed by the laws of temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and a host of other factors. 
        Our governments are systems consisting of a set of actors, each wielding a certain amount of power and influence. State and local governments, which are separate subsystems, may interact with each other or overlap and interfere with each other's behaviors.
      
        Intelligence then might be defined as a framework to learning the rules of each of these subsystems first by exploration, and then exploiting them for some goal in mind. 
        The end goal that the environment is being exploited for isn't the most important thing; whats important is <i> how </i> the environment is being exploited. 
        Intelligent agents are limited by the fundamental laws of physics, and cannot exploit the world past those laws. 
        The fact that they might <i> discover </i> new laws is a different story.
      
        So far, what humans have done in terms of A.I is develop agents that can exploit extremely limited subsystems, and that too with extensive supervision. A robot
        exploring a mining shaft for ore interacts with its extremely limited environment using a mixture of Deep Learning (supervised learning) and rule-based-learning (expert systems). It still
        does not have the curiosity or the flexibility to learn <i> new </i> rules without being explicitly instructed. Until humans crack the curiosity problem, we will be stuck with machines that cannot think for themselves.
      
        This analysis also brings about a more sinister idea, which is the possibility of existence of different kinds of intelligences. If we might define all types intelligence as a massive surface in Hilbert space, then human intelligence is but a tiny point. 
        Chimpanzee intelligence is a point lying nearby, and octopus and pig intelligence is not too far away either.
      
        But, given the insane size of Hilbert space, there might be other types of intelligence out there that we simply might not be able to comprehend, that are infinitely more powerful at some, if not all tasks that humans are adept at. 
      
        And those intelligences simply might not be benevolent to us apes.
      
        Cheers!
