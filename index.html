	<h1>Hi there, I'm Malhar Jere!</h1>

	<p>I'm currently a Deep Learning Research Engineer at Apple. I currently work on deep neural networks for computer vision that get integrated into the broader Apple ecosystem. </p>
	
	<p>In a previous life I was a graduate student at UC San Diego, where I worked in the incredible <a href="http://aceslab.org/">ACESLab</a> advised by the awesome <a href="https://farinaz.eng.ucsd.edu/home"> Professor Farinaz Koushanfar </a>. 
	
	<br><br>
		
	Prior to that, I graduated from UIUC with a BS in Electrical Engineering, where I did research in <a href="http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/"> Paul Kwiat's group</a> working with satellites and quantum optics and in <a href="http://www.varshney.csl.illinois.edu/"> Lav Varshney's group</a> working on connectome models to understand the human brain.

	<br><br>
		
	My research interests lie in: (1) understanding deep neural networks, and (2) making them more trustworthy, safe, secure and private. I was previously a Machine Learning Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://x.company/"> X </a> (formerly Google X) working on an undisclosed project.

	<br><br>

	Outside of work my hobbies I love hiking, cooking and reading. Check out my <a href="/book_reviews"> reading list </a>, and feel free to contact me at malhar.jere(at)gmail.com if you'd like to collaborate!
