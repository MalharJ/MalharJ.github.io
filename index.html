	<h1>Hi there, I'm Malhar Jere!</h1>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>I'm a graduate student at UC San Diego, where I work in the incredible <a href="http://aceslab.org/">ACESLab</a> advised by the awesome <a href="https://farinaz.eng.ucsd.edu/home"> Professor Farinaz Koushanfar </a>. Previously, I graduated from UIUC with a BS in Electrical Engineering, where I did research in <a href="http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/"> Paul Kwiat's group</a> working with satellites and quantum optics.

	<br>
		
	My interests primarily lie in understanding neural networks and devising tools to interpret their behavior. I'm also interested in machine learning security and robustness, and helping make machines understand the world the same way humans do. I'm currently an AI Resident at <a href="https://x.company/"> X </a> (formerly Google X) working on an undisclosed project.

	<br>

	Outside of work my hobbies I love hiking, cooking and reading. Check out my <a href="/book_reviews"> reading list </a>!
