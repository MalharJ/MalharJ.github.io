        I was at a conference today, and someone was talking about the potential of machine learning to discover patterns that 
        humans couldn't normally pick up on. Aside from the fact that everyone seems to be talking about the promise of 
        machine learning to solve medicine/security/random business problem, this topic got me thinking along a different tangent; why are there patterns at all?
        
        As an undergraduate student at UIUC I had an extremely deep interest in Quantum Mechanics and all the weird 
        things that surround it, and I took a lot of Quantum and Statistical Physics classes. According to statistical physics,
        particles are always wobbling around with some energy and bumping into things all around them and throwing their energy all around.
        
      (to be continued - work in progress at the moment)
