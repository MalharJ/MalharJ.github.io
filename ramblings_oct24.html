        I've been having an existential crisis as of late with respect to adversarial samples. In simple terms, adversarial samples
        are inputs to artificial neural networks that might appear benign or normal to humans, but can fool a computer into thinking
        a cat is a shovel, or a plane, or a dog, or a car, or anything the neural network might be able to predict.
        
        It's been bothering me for quite sometime. What even in the world are adversarial samples? They go in the face of any logic that I know of.
        If neural networks work in ANY way like human brains, then we should know that its damn near impossible to fool humans. 
        You can't just add some random noise to a cat and try to convince me that its a dog. That just doesn't work. Maybe humans
        have some kind of different learning algorithm to distinguish between objects.
